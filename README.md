# 👋 Nabil Sajjad

🧠 A 15-year-old high school student (Class 10), independently researching advanced **Artificial Intelligence**, **Robotics**, and **Brain–Computer Interfaces**.

Currently developing the research foundation for **EXOCORTEX** — a meta-cognitive, emotion-adaptive, brain-controlled system aimed at restoring agency for individuals with motor impairments.

This initiative is not just academic; it serves as the groundwork for a future assistive-tech startup focused on empowering the differently-abled through affordable, intelligent neuro-robotics.
