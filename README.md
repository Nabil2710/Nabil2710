# 👋 Nabil Sajjad

I'm 15, in high school, and deeply obsessed with building the future of AI, robotics, and brain–machine tech.

Right now, I’m working on **EXOCORTEX** — a meta-cognitive, emotion-adaptive robotic system controlled by the brain. It’s not just a project — it’s a mission. My goal is to one day turn this into a startup that creates intelligent assistive technology for differently-abled individuals.

Millions of people have lost the ability to move, to express, or even to feel safe — not because their mind is gone, but because their body can’t follow. I want to change that. If the brain still speaks, the machine should listen. EXOCORTEX is my way of proving that thought itself can become action again.

This journey starts with research — original papers, simulated models, and raw conviction. And it ends with tech that brings **freedom**, **dignity**, and **control** back into the lives of those who’ve lost it.
